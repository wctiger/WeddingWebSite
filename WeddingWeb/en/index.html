            <p class="cap">We are opposites. Xiao is a big guy and Jingyi is a small girl. Xiao is a nice and friendly big brother to everyone. He’s talkative and caring; he loves to be responsible for all the everyday things people have to deal with at home and he’s also the one who cooks. He cares about others’ feelings and keeps secrets to himself. He makes Jingyi feel so protected and loved. </p>
            <p class="cap">Jingyi, on the other hand, is more reserved and less sentimental. She focuses on the big picture and she takes care of planning for the future of the family as well as Jingyi and Xiao’s individual goals. Jingyi isn’t as preoccupied with others’ feelings and forges ahead on the project at hand. She is smiley but only when she herself is happy. She is ambitious and self-motivated in all aspects. She drives Xiao out of his warm bed to go to work. The family consists of Xiao, the big and gentle golden retriever, and Jingyi who has a similar personality to their two very proud cats.</p>
            <p class="cap">While in some ways polar opposites, the two have many commonalities.  They explore the world together and are adventurous in a reasonable, safe way.  They deeply understand each other’s minds and emotions and share all the smiles and tears in one another’s lives. Additionally and perhaps most important, they view the world through almost the same perspective and share similar values.  They agree that to carry on together, they will strive to be better as a couple. The best way to enhance their lives and future is to face everything together, which is why they decided to get married and grow old together!</p>

            </div>
            <div class="party__desc">
                <p class="cap">It all began on a tour to New York City organized by the couple’s college, Stevens Institute of Technology, in late August 2011. Jingyi saw Xiao for the first time when he ran into the PATH train that Jingyi was traveling on from Hoboken to the city. The tall and thin guy wearing glasses introduced himself to her right away.  But that wasn’t the first time Xiao saw Jingyi. According to Xiao, he noticed Jingyi several days before on his way to school and fell in love at first sight. </p>
                <p>Xiao became what appeared to be a very good friend to Jingyi.  He showed up at all the parties she attended, listened attentively to her happy and sad news, and stories about her day. He seemed to care about her and they had fun together.  Jingyi considered him a close friend, maybe even a best friend. </p>
                <p>On the first Valentine’s Day after they met, during their online chat in the early morning, Jingyi told Xiao that she had never received any red roses from anyone. She told him, “Yes, I’ve received flowers.  But they were not red roses, the type of flowers that I really like the most.” </p>
                <p>Much to her surprise, a half an hour after their conversation, Xiao showed up at her door with a bouquet of beautiful red roses. He handed her the flowers, wished her a Happy Valentine’s Day and then ran away.  Jingyi appreciated the flowers very much, but she didn’t realize that love was right around the corner.</p>
                <p>Xiao assumed Jingyi knew that he cared for her as a girlfriend. Jingyi wasn’t clear about his intentions and feelings at all. After dinner with friends on February 16th, the two sat privately and talked. Xiao confessed his love for her. As such a sweet person, he didn’t blame her for what Jingyi called her “insensitivity.”</p>
                <p>A bit shocked (she thought they had hung out for half a year together as friends), Jingyi needed a bit of time to process things and adjust. She too had developed feelings for Xiao and they continued to spend wonderful times together. Clearly they were now dating. By March of 2012, it was official. When Jingyi’s friend visited from the West Coast, she introduced Xiao as her “boyfriend.”</p>

            <div class="party__header">                
                <h2 class="party__title">The Proposal</h2>
              </div>
              <div class="party__desc">
                  <p class="cap">It was their fourth anniversary together and Jingyi noticed Xiao acting a bit more excited than usual before they left on a trip. Unbeknownst to her, he had been carrying an engagement ring with him since the first day of their Alaska trip on March 21st. </p>
                  <p>But he couldn’t find the perfect time to pop the question and present her with the special ring. He planned to propose under the well-known Northern Lights. Unfortunately, the weather didn’t cooperate and they were always surrounded by crowds of people, so it didn’t seem like the right moment. The only time Xiao didn’t bring the ring along with him was on the day that the couple went cross country skiing.  The view was wonderful on that afternoon. Xiao later told Jingyi that he regretted leaving the ring behind as he felt it would’ve made a good time to propose.</p>
                  <p>On the last day of the trip, March 28, 2016, Xiao could no longer wait to ask the woman he loved to marry him. Nor could he contain his excitement any longer. Xiao secretly set up a camera at a hidden place on the mountain top and just then, Jingyi happened to notice what he was doing. Something marvelous was about to happen.</p>
                  <p>Xiao finally got down on one knee. He offered Jingyi the beautiful engagement ring and proposed to Jingyi on top of an unknown snowy mountain in beautiful Alaska.  He was the most nervous that she had ever seen him! Jingyi nodded her head, exclaimed yes and cried.  Xiao hugged Jingyi with trembling hands. </p>
                  <p class="cap">Although it wasn’t the proposal that Xiao had planned on their great trip to Alaska to Jingyi, it was just perfect and a day she’d never forget.</p>
